# Digital Signatures and Quantum Cryptanalysis

In this project, we explore the application of algebraic graph theory to develop cryptographic protocols that are resilient to quantum attacks. Specifically, we analyze the spectral and algebraic properties of Cayley graphs, expander graphs, and isogeny graphs to construct secure systems for digital signatures and key generation. By leveraging adjacency matrices and eigenvalues, we establish cryptographic primitives and evaluate their robustness.
Our work involves generating these graph types and performing spectral analysis, focusing on key metrics like spectral gap, spectral radius, and algebraic connectivity, which are crucial for cryptographic strength. We implement a graph-based digital signature scheme and assess its signature uniqueness and verification accuracy.
To test quantum resilience, we simulate Grover’s algorithm and Shor’s algorithm to identify potential vulnerabilities in graph-based schemes. While Grover’s attack highlights partial reductions in security, Shor’s simulation demonstrates robustness under specific conditions. Additionally, we optimize the scalability of these methods using parallel computation, enabling spectral analysis for large-scale graphs.
The results show that isogeny graphs offer advanced post-quantum potential, while Cayley and expander graphs provide strong cryptographic properties. This study highlights the viability of graph-based cryptography for secure communication in a quantum era and sets a foundation for further research into advanced graph structures and attack simulations.
